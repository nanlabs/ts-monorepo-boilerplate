## Pre-packed

### Dev tools

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Turbo](https://turborepo.com/) - A monorepo manager for JavaScript and TypeScript
- [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) - A way to manage your versioning and changelogs with a focus on multi-package repositories
- [npm-run-all](https://github.com/mysticatea/npm-run-all) - Run multiple npm-scripts in parallel or sequential
- [eslint](https://eslint.org/) - Linting utility for JavaScript and JSX
- [prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Opinionated code formatter
- [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) - Git hooks made easy
- [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged) - Run linters against staged git files and don't let ðŸ’© slip into your code base!

### Continuous Integration

We use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to run our continuous integration pipeline. The pipeline is defined in the [ci.yml](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) file. The pipeline runs the following steps:

- **Linter** - Runs the linter on the project (using `npm run lint`). This step will fail if the linter finds any errors.
- **Type Check** - Runs the type checker on the project (using `npm run typecheck`). This step will fail if the type checker finds any errors.
- **Shell Check** - Runs the shell checker on the project. This step will fail if the shell checker finds any errors.
- **Markdown Lint** - Runs the markdown linter on the project. This step will fail if the markdown linter finds any errors.
- **TODOs to GitHub Issues** - Creates GitHub issues for all TODOs in the project.
- **Pull Request Review** - Adds a comment to the pull request with a summary of the changes.

## Applications and Services

- **Playground** - A [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) playground.
- **React App** - React app created with [create-awesome-node-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-awesome-node-app) powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
- **Nest.js Service** - Nest.js service created using the [Basic Starter for NestJS on AWS Lambda with Serverless](https://github.com/nanlabs/devops-reference/tree/main/examples/serverless-node-typescript-nest).
- **WebExtension** - WebExtension created with [create-awesome-node-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-awesome-node-app) powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [WebExtension-Polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill).

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- NodeJS - **Youâ€™ll need to have Node 18.15.0 or later on your local development machine** (but itâ€™s not required on the server). You can use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

### Setup Local Environment

- Setup the correct NodeJS version using `fnm` and install dependencies.

```sh
fnm use
export NODE_AUTH_TOKEN=<your-npm-token>
npm install
```

> NOTE: if you are working in a `arm64` platform (e.g MacBook with m1 or m2 chip), you might need to run `npm i turbo && npm i`.

- Run the local dev environment.

```sh
npm run local:up
```

### Running the Applications

Each app and service has its own `README.md` file with instructions on how to run it locally.

### Available Scripts
